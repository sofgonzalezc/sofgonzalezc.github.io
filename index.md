### Favorite Labs from CPSC 120L
* Lab 01:
  
  It set an example for the rest of the labs throughout the semester. I also got to get comfortable with using Linux, GitHub, and VS Code. It was also enjoyable getting used to the concept of the Driver and Navigator since I’m used to working individually. 

* Lab 02:

  In Lab 2, it was fun to create a game that I’ve known since my childhood. The Madlib was interesting to create from scratch, and not off a piece of paper. It was also cool to go beyond the aspect of the “Hello World!” project, and create something different. 

* Lab 06:
  
  In part 1 of the lab, we got to make a sandwich by filling in the blanks, like the previous Mad Lib from Lab 2. We got to make a program that would follow that pattern to read the components of a sandwich. I found it very enjoyable to make.
